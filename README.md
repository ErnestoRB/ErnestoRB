## *Hey!* It's Ernesto! :wave:
Currently I'm coursing my first year of college. I'm trying to become an successful software engineer.

My first git project was [AsteroidesC-G](https://github.com/ErnestoRB/AsteroidesC-G). You should check it out.

What I love:
- My family :family_man_woman_girl_boy:
- Make a solution for any kind of problem :bulb:
- Improve my knowledges :brain:
- Hang out :people_holding_hands:
- Listen to music every single second. :headphones:

Life doesn't have any kind of ``` git revert ``` to go back, always thank past, enjoy the present and follow the future!
